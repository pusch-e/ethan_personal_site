                        While at LenelS2, I worked as a part of their Video Management System (VMS) team. I contributed
                        to their flagship video system product, the VRx. Upon joining, I was eager to contribute to VRx's
                        exciting, in progress feature--its real-time object detection based surveillence software. Although I 
                        have since taken a Computer Systems course (after my time with LenelS2), I was unfamiliar 
                        with their tech stack at the start of my co-op assignment. I had to quickly become familiar with 
                        Ubuntu Linux and working strictly with the command line interface. After self-teaching REST commands
                        to interact with their APIs and daemons, I developed a variety of test platforms in Python, C#, and Bash. 
                        These utilities were used in order to support back-end features of the VRx. Despite the disruption that
                        the Covid-19 virus caused halfway through my co-op experience, I continued to work dilligently even after
                        transitioning to working remotely. While remote, I examined a threading issue that was affecting the performance
                        of a daemon related to camera analytics. I also created a logging function in C++ in order to output 
                        important debugging information from the new data pipeline that LenelS2 was implementing. I am grateful 
                        for my experience at LenelS2 and look forward to continuing to grow as a software engineer!

                        My internships at Xogene allowed me to get my feet wet in the world of software engineering, as this was my first
                        time working in an agile team development environment. I was still in highschool during this experience, so this
                        opportunity was great as I realized how much I had yet to learn. Xogene is a startup company that has a light-weight,
                        but strong software team. Due to the small company size, I was able to directly communicate with higher-ups and gain
                        exposure to our front end features in a much closer way than I would have been able to at another company. While here,
                        I developed cross browser test scripts using Python and Selenium in order to verify their new front end features.
                        I also produced unique and interactive elements that were integrated into their dashboard product using
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Lastly, I helped develop their Environmental Monitoring platform. This platform allows
                        clients to stay up to date with the most recent regulatory information regarding pharmaceutical laws and requirements.

                        This is one of the most fun work experiences that I have had. SummerTech is a summer camp that I used to attend,
                        and it was here where I initally learned how to code. I chose to learn Java as my first language because it was 
                        the most popular course while I was attending. Once I was old enough, I was applied to become a teacher.
                        With all of the Java experience that I had under my belt from attending the camp for years, I was offered my first 
                        job as a junior Java teacher. Over the course of 5 weeks, I was given 2-4 students to teach each week. Each 
                        student had varying levels of experience with coding, and I had to assign projects based on their
                        respective proficiencies with Java. Outside of class, I was a counselour who was tasked with other duties
                        related to ensuring entertainment and safety for the students in their extra cirricular activites while at SummerTech.
